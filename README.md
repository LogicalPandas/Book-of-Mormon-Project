# Book-of-Mormon-Project

This code allows you to anaylze the Book of Mormon for topics and words, and outputs the results into various CSVs to allow for visualization in Tableau, etc (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tyler.jeanneret/viz/MusicintheBookofMormon/Dashboard1)

The Analyzer file is where the code is found
Every other file is just info or input/outputs for that file
